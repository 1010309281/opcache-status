opcache-status
==============

A one-page opcache status page for the PHP 5.5 opcode cache.

You don't need the opcode cache installed to help out with this.
See the data-sample.php file for a dump of the data.

I know it is rather ugly, so please spruce it up. But I would like
to keep it relatively small and to a single file so it is easy to 
drop into a directory anywhere without worrying about separate css/js/php
files.
